# function to know datatype of variable
# in pyton type of variable is dynamic
# everything in python is object, so each have classes.
# SYNTAX
# type(variable_name)
# but we have to print that.
# so, print(type(variable_name))
a = 132
print(a)
print(type(a))
print('\n')
print('****************\n')

a = 13.36
print(a)
print(type(a))
print('\n')
print('****************\n')

a = 'A'
print(a)
print(type(a))
print('\n')
print('****************\n')

a = [2, 3, 5, 8]
print(a)
print(type(a))

# In python most datatypes are immutable.
# It prefers creating new data, instead of modifying existing one.
